Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
Approach- The intuition behind this approach is that if an element occurs more than n/2 times in the array (where n is the size of the array), it will always occupy the middle position when the array is sorted. Therefore, we can sort the array and return the element at index n/2

ums.sort()
        n=len(nums)
        return nums[n//2]
