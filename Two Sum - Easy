Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
APPROACH- 
we do it by transversing through each number and starting an if loop to see if the sum of 2 index numbers equals the target and if it does equal the target we return. here we have to give output in square brackets i made that mistake in output so i didnt get it so better use return[i,j] 

Solution- (python)
n= len(nums)
        for i in range (n-1):
            for j in range (i+1,n):
                if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target):
                    return [i,j]
