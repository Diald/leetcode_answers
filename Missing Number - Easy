to find the missing number in the array having n elements
for example- 
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
here we used the math approach that if we do the sum of all numbers in the range [0,n] where n= len(nums) and then subtract it with the sum of all elements of array we would get the missing number, the mistake could be that here range starts from 0 so the formula (n+1)*(n+2)/2 will work when only for n-1
SOLUTION- 
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n= len(nums)
        total = (n)*(n + 1)/2
        sum_of_A = sum(nums)
        return int(total - sum_of_A)
