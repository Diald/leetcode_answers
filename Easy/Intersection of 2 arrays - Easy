Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

1. set is used to remove all the duplicate elements from the array. to convert an array into set. Set is ordered non repeating collection of elements. example of set are- {1,2,"apple","red"} it can have different datatypes too 
Syntax- 
x = set(nums)

2. intersect method is like mathematical intersection method. it gives the common elements of both sets. note that only sets and it returns a set only. 
x.intersect(y)

3. Union method is also like mathematical union. it gives elements of the both sets, both unique and common elements. it also returns a set only. its syntax is- 
x.union(y)

        x= set(nums1)
        y= set(nums2)
        return list(x.intersection(y))
