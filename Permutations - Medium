this is also very similar to combinations example, here also we have to find subsets 
Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
approach- in all subsets questions we are going to use recursion or backtracking 
Solution- 
   def backtrack(first=1, current=[]):
            k= len(nums)
            if len(current) == k:
                output.append(current[:])
            for i in range(first,k +1):
                current.append(i)
                backtrack(i + 1, current)
                current.pop()

        output = []
        backtrack()
        return output
