'''Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 105'''

if(k%2 == 0 or k%5==0):
  return -1
prev_num = 0
for n in range(k):
  prev_num = ((prev_num*10)+1)%k
  if(prev_num == 0):
    return n+1
return -1
